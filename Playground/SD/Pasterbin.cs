         Functional use-cases:
         - User can enter text and get URL
         - User can enter URL and get text

         - User can update text keeping the same URL (?)
         - User can remove "URL" and text accordingly  -timeout
          
        Non - functional use-cases:
         - Availability over Consistency
         - System should prevent data lost
         - Minimal latency for reading
         - Max text length: 1024 Kb symbols
         - Picture/Video not supported
         - Hard timeout exist in case user don't define
         
        Extended functionality cases:
         - Logging, Monitoring, Reporting
         - Analytics

        Metrics / Work load:
         - More writes than reads: 10 : 1
         - Writes per month: 10 mln
            a) Write Requests 10 mln / 30 / 24 / 3600 = ~ 4 QPS 
            b) Read Requests 10 mln * 10 / 30 / 24 / 3600 = ~ 40 QPS 
         
        Storage metric:
        - Max upload: 10 mln * 1024Kb = 1Gb per month
              max time to keep 1 year : 12Gb storage

        Bandwidth estimates:
           - 4 per sec * 1024Kb ~ 4kB per sec

        Memory cache:
            - 20% of traffic to cache.
            100 mln requests to read per month * 0.2 * 1Kb = 20mln * 1Kb = 20Gb for month
